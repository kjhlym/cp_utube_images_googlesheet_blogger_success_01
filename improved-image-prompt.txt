TITLE: Modern Product Thumbnail Template

PROMPT: A 1200x630 pixel modern, minimalist product thumbnail template for an e-commerce website. The template features a high-quality product image of [Specify product here.  Be VERY specific. Example: "a stainless steel water bottle with a matte black finish and a paracord handle"] occupying the left two-thirds of the frame. The right third contains the product title "[Product Title - Keep it Short]" in a clean, sans-serif font (e.g., Helvetica, Arial) with good contrast against the background. Below the title, display the price "[Price]" in a slightly smaller, but still easily readable, sans-serif font. Ensure there is sufficient whitespace around the text and image for a clean, uncluttered look. The overall design should be sleek and contemporary.  The background should be a neutral color. The lighting on the product should be soft and even, highlighting its features.  The template should be easily adaptable for different products by simply swapping out the product image, title, and price.  The composition should be balanced and aesthetically pleasing.  The image should appear professional and high-quality, suitable for a high-end brand. The style should resemble a website product display thumbnail.

STYLE:  Modern, minimalist, clean, sleek, professional, e-commerce product photography, flat lay (if applicable to your product), slightly elevated perspective (if applicable), realistic rendering.

COLORS: Neutral background (white, light gray, or a very light pastel), black or dark gray text for high contrast, accent color for the price (optional - consider a subtle color that complements the product).  If the product itself has vibrant colors, the background should remain neutral to allow the product to stand out.
